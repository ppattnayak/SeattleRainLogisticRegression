# Seattle Rain Prediction using Logistic Regression
Predicting Rainfall at SEATAC airport using Logistic Regression

# Scope of the Project
This project will provide a step-by-step guide for building a logistic regression model using R. Here, we will be using a 'binomial logistic regression', as the decision variable can have only two values. However, we can also predict a decision variable with more than three vallues, using logistic regression. This type of regression is called 'Multinomial Logistic Regression'. In this project, we predict the probablity of rainfall at SEATAC airport in Seattle.
